## Concerning Topic

Basically most posts in this blog will be about, well I hope, Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc. But maybe there will be something else.

The languages used here will be Chinese, English, Japanese ... and maybe a little bit Elvish and Thalassian. I just like those nerdy stuff.
