# I
Practical Obscurity [1] is somewhat similar with the idea of *stenography*, i.e. hiding needle in a haystack. For example, a file is as good as burned if buried in the archives considering the difficulty of searching it manually --- until the computers become so powerful at a dizzying speed. 

A few examples:

- Your information/pattern : Linked databases + Cloud Computing
- Your trace : Easy-access Visual Record Tech + Growing Storage
- What you said : NLP
- Human Intelligence : AI (Chess)
- ...

We can no longer assume every piece of information we generated can go easily without others' knowing. It is even not about any people want to spy on you purposefully. It just happens with fast developing techs around.

# II 
So now image a machine that can remember every piece of nitty-gritty from your life, understand what you say, and propose a genius solution to a potential problem of yours. Can you REALLY sure it is a machine, rather than some kind-hearted neighbor? Just as Kevin Kelly [2] said, the line between *the born* and *the made* are growing obfuscating. Our own creations affect our lives in a profound way like never before. It is clear that to create future systems we have to gain deep insight from the nature. 

(I say, cut the chains, and let these creatures be free.)

# III
Linked database, pattern searching, computing source clusters, mass storage, artificial intelligence ... These are exactly what makes our life convenient. So here comes what I would call **See-Saw Games** about privacy: you can hardly define a clear boundary where technologies can breach privacy as much as it benefit us. Some terrorists attacks, you will be on one side; a large scale information leak, then the other end. This is not a reasonable way of thinking for a CSer. Just as many other fields, a profound basis and some most important principles must be required to fully understand such topics as privacy/terrorits/freedom etc., which by no means consists of not only those superficial news and personal-emotion-driven outcries, but more importantly the classical reasoning and philosophers such as John S. Mill and Jeremy Bentham. 

# IV
However, please do not get me wrong. Though technology plays such an important role changing the landscape of privacy, they are but tools, and its us, we the people who decide where we are going. Think about it, even 

# V
At least, we can start trying to set some loose boundary. For example, a gene database can both raise your concern about the leak of your personal data and be used to locate criminals in a murder efficiently. But think about a database with gene data of all UK residents, targeting at identifying ALL criminals. Or worse, it may go a step further and vow to locate all POSSIBLE criminals BEFORE they commit any crime. Even though it sounds like a tempting vision, we can almost 100% sure that it will lead to something terrible.

Speaking of crime, one of this week's headlines is the murderers of [Becky Watts](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-34790804) are finally found. One analysis of the Guardian points out that there are a series of similar cases, and in all of these cases the murders all have special interested in violent pornography. It may imply that you should watch out for any of your neighbors who likes violent porn. 

Of course this topic worth a wide debate. But I think 1). It could also be possible that they choose to like violent porn and commit crimes just because that's who they are in the first place, not the other way around; 2) we should be at least vigilant about any potential standard and "black-list". No great purges in human history are not built on those beautiful and dangerous ideology.
