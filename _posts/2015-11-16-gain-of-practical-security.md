In my last blog we see how the fast-developing technologies breaches our "practical obscurity". But we should also notice that technologies themselves are to an large extent neutual. As what we'll see, a selective of technologies are also there to be used if we seek to protect our own privacy.

As to theoretial foundations, some most important ideas including: cryptographt, stenography, and authentication. However, here we'll cover practical applications. In a recent interview, Ed Snowden explained how to [reclaim our privacy](https://theintercept.com/2015/11/12/edward-snowden-explains-how-to-reclaim-your-privacy/). Sounds like a quite vague topic. But it is indeed very practical and insightful. I tried to do a brief summarise.

In the real world, we will talk about **Practical Security**. Basically it means that, yes, we cannot totally hide everything about ourselves to others, especially state-level agency like NSA and GCHQ, but at the same time, not everyone needs that kind of security strength. The most important thing is to make clear your **Personal Threat Model**: what are your practical privacy threats? This is the beginning step.

Unless you are a potential whistleblower, then a series of simple actions are enough to practically protect your privacy. A for-everyone-recommendation:

- Encrypt your phone calls/SMS with [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/). Easy to use. 

- Encrypt your hard disk on [different OS](https://theintercept.com/2015/04/27/encrypting-laptop-like-mean/).

- Password Manager: different pws for different site without memorizing them. [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) is a great tool. *([Pico](http://mypico.org/) is taking on a quite interesting approach, although the idea of getting rid of  passwords cannot be fully applied. )*

- Two factor authentication. Actually it is an approach that has already been widely used in big sites like Google & Facebook. *(What make its success?)*

More serious methods:

- Tor. Tor. Tor. 

> Tor is the most important privacy-enhancing technology project being used... If you’re not using Tor you’re doing it wrong.

Its power comes from its idea -- decentralization & volunteer participation.

- Virtualisation(?) [Qubes OS Project](https://www.qubes-os.org/) is said to be a very promising project. Note that it is Xen-drived. Quite interesting.
- Greater hardening of Every OS. What we lack currently. [MirageOS](https://mirage.io) must be quite promising.

Anyway, the principle is that:

1. Think about vulnerability. Your mobile phone.
2. Selective Sharing. Everybody does not have to know everything.

Remember, whether you want to spy on others or protect yourselves against it, you can always find suitable tools. Tech is just tech. Even the survilliance technologies are great steps forward. It's always we the people who defines if its evil or not. (Pure-evil technology exists?)
