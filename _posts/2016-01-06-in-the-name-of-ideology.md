I have to say something about Amazon's recommendation systems -- it just shows so little variance: I search for headphone, and it recommend to me a bunch of other headphones (not even a earphone!); I search *A Dance of Dragons*, and it shows me the other G.R.R. Martin book (how about a little bit of *Lord of the Rings*? Thank you!); I search kettles, and all of a sudden my homepage is full of all kinds of kettles (Apparently, ALL I need in my kitchen is a kettle, not some more knife, not maybe some pot, but just kettles). 

I can say that this whole system never really works for me. When I decide to buy a kettle or headphone, I've probably already gone through different items Amazon can offer; after my purchase, it is also highly likely that I'll not buy the same thing right away. And the most important thing is that its recommendations just change so damn fast. Just look up one more item and all the previous recommendation are gone, like an interest in headphones will surely make you do no want to buy a kettle never ever again. 

So here is my question. I'm pretty sure Amazon relies heavily on its performance of recommendation system, but then why it works so awful for me? Is it because I happen to be a difficult customer? Or is this exactly what the system is suppose to be? I've not purchase enough on Amazon so they lack necessary data? Is it indeed quite difficult to recommend items  like Netflix does on movies or iTunes on music?  I must have missed something.

Being cynic is not the proper attitude...

> "Words are wind."

Finally, after a series of talks about Privacy, we can talk censorships & surveillance. Actually, when we are talking about privacy, chances are that we are actually talking about censorships & surveillance: NSA, Snowden, GCHQ, etc.

Here we should first know *Decisional Privacy* or *Ideology Privacy*: one can make  decision and pursue ideas without hindrance or pressure from anyone else.  Sounds familiar? Right, we often call it *freedom*, yet also a kind of privacy if you think about it. For example, the right to abortion. You can see that how such topic can lead to fierce arguments from every walks of life. Then comes the violation to your ideological privacy, in the form of *Censorship*. The funny thing is that most oppression of ideological privacy is exactly enacted in the name of ideology.  Think different governments, religions.

In some circumstances, "fighting for privacy" is synonym of "fighting for freedom" or even "fighting against the government". For the lucky ones, though, they are allowed to know better than that.  Sometimes these different kinds of privacy are even at odds with each other: information privacy requires you to hide/control, and decisional privacy to share. 

OK, that brief paragraph draws a period to my reflection of the book *The Spy in the Coffee Machine* -- Really good for anyone who want to approach the topic of "privacy" -- I talked and talked, but words are wind. Without examples and being put into action, these words are nothing but dull.

> "Elementary, my dear Watson."

My recent work concerns how to make configurations more usable, such as MultiNet[^multinet].  I came to realize that to make configurations as dummy as possible and to simplify the work is by no means trivial job. On the contrary, people is the most unpredictable part of any system, and any improvement to make the behaviour more controllable is much appreciated.  This is about HCI.
 
Just like what we said again and again, the security/privacy rely heavily on users. The works of [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick) like *The Art of Intrusion* shows vividly how a seemingly impregnable system can fall because of some people make some minor mistakes --- even though these stories are about active attacks rather than unintentional (and more frequent and more lethal) mistakes. To deal with system, even though a world without ambiguities is so wonderful,  you can never ignore the user --- you have no idea how fool or smart they are. Chaos Prevails! Psychology matters! Make your work foolproof!  --- well, it doesn't necessarily means you have to treat your user like idiots, just don't give them any chance to prove they are. Think about iPhone. 

By the way, the greatest inventions can come from ordinary, out of the box. (On distributed vs. IoT vs. QubeOS.)
