[This report](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf)[^godark] of Harvard presents an public debate about the government's claim that their ability to investigate crimes is "going dark" with encryption technologies are being widely used in mainstream consumer products. Here I'd like to briefly summarize this report. The interesting thing is that, soon after the report is published, a ["fight"](https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/) between Apple and US government draws people's eyes upon encryption. The declaration of Tim Cook was soon echoed  by [Google](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11040266/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-sides-with-apple-encryption) and [Facebook](https://recode.net/2016/02/22/mark-zuckerberg-defends-apple-we-believe-in-encryption/).

The complaints of DoJ and FBI are not totally without sense. In fact, I'm surprised and delighted to find out that some major tech players have made extraordinary efforts to make encryption part of our life. For example, WhatsApp [integrates](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/whatsapp-encrypted-messaging/) end-to-end encryption opensource software TextSecure (which still holds true [now](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/03/brazil-frees-facebook-exec-arrested-over-whatsapp-data-linked-to-drug-case)). Now with the battle between Apple and FBI, at least about one thing we can sure: the content in our iPhone is indeed immune to bruteforce attacks. Starting from Lollipop, Google's Android also follow suit and enable device encryption by default. These improvements are all transparent to users, which means everything.  So it's true that some contents are difficult to get for the authorities. 

However, "going dark" is a wrong/misleading metaphor.  What tech companies can do is limited, and only the users have the final saying in their own data and privacy. Yes, all the content in your iPhone is encrypted, but that doesn't mean a careless setting will not leaks your nude photo on iCloud to the world. In most cases, end-to-end encryption still makes it inconvenient for normal users to communicate, let alone difficult to properly configure. And don't forget how fragmented are some software systems, like Android.  When users/companies are not in a hurry to update their phones, it is difficult to harness the up-to-date encryption feature. So what faces the FBIs is far from a united "enemy".

Besides, even the end-to-end encryption is implemented in WhatsApp, it still goes against business models of many companies: how could I display accurate advertisement if the behaviour of my clients are *totally* encrypted?  Do not forget the "[Filter bubble](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Filter-Bubble-What-Internet-Hiding/dp/0241954525)", knowing that most companies are actually trying to capture as many data from clients in the pursue of personalized recommendation. Many services are also relied upon access to users' data: Google support full text search of cloud documents, and iCloud is capable of decrypted by Apple in case users lose everything. 

The Old Way is still available. Metadata can not be encrypted for the systems to operate: location, calling records, email heads, etc. New gates is opening: With sensors everywhere, the IoT trend brings numerous chance for governments to access multi-dimensional information of citizens. When your own [TV is spying](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/05/your-samsung-smarttv-is-spying-on-you-basically.html) on you,  I fail to see why they are still complaining.  Glory to Surveillance! 

And, hello, haven't we been hearing about how NSA can spy every single person on the planet from Merkel and Burlusconi to every ordinary citizen, then why all of a sudden they become the innocent lamb, crying for not able to get an apple from daddy? Since when did decryption becomes THE only thing an intelligence agency cares? Did 911 happen because they were busy decrypting messages that morning or that they just failed to have any clue about the attack beforehand at all? Think about similar terrorist attacks by ISIL recently.

The world is lingering with regimes that are trying to stick their fat noses to every corner of rooms of their people. Secrets may seemingly work for a while, but will shatter the very foundations of our free world in the long run. We know exactly what a society looks like when it works on secrets, and as far as we know, it collapsed 30 years ago, leaving foul legacies to this day and future. No, my lords, this is not the way. I say, the salvation lies within openness ...
