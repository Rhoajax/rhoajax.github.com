Some summary of part of *The Spy in the Coffee Machine* ...

## I
Just find something fun before the topic: 1. Google "Privatised space" and "privatized space", you'll get quite different result. 2. Roman numerals does not include zero.

## II
When talking about privacy, We'd be wise to know the difference of three kinds of "space" as context. We are familiar with *Public Space*, where the public take active participation in collective decision-making. One example is maybe President Election. It would be absurd for a candidate to claim that the vote he/she get is personal privacy and refuse to let it go public. We also quite familiar with *Private Space*: few man is OK with a camera in his/her bedroom, and its always illegal to break into someone's house without his permission. A third space, the *Privatised Space*, sits between those two. It is of public life, sociability and public opinion, but the participants do not have to hold a motivation for public good. Think about a *salon*, a coffee house, or a lecture room. It may generate some daily gossip, or a great revolution. Your opinion may reach to all the audience, or nobody at all. The Web, as we can imagine, is also one of these interesting privatised spaces.

Development in technologies (for decentralized control and public participation) and juristic system undoubtedly promote free speech. One may think that free speech equals privacy. But if you think about it, they are quite different ideas. Actually, what shores up free speech actually erode your privacy, at least part of it. The key point here is trying not to imagine an Owellian government, and just a normal, western democratic one. A Greek *polis* if you like. Otherwise it will be difficult to tell them apart. 

Web serves great as a powerful tool for promoting decentralization and free speech, because the very essence of the Web is to disseminating information. Not game, online purchase or keep some secrete files. Information, link by link, to as many users as possible. Privacy is definitely not on its list of priority when Sir Berners-Lee create it.

It pure essence make a firm ground for what the Web is now: chaotic, decentralized place, with many different standard, language, formalism and purposes -- exactly what our really world looks like. A Chaotic Neutral. This lead to another topic: oppression on the Internet. We'll leave that to later chapter.

Be awareness is an essential, maybe the first step in promoting personal privacy. What is your online environment? What are some possible threatens for you? What method they use? What tech can you use to to protect yourself? How can the laws come to help?... (See [previous post](http://loghorizon.logdown.com/posts/314066)) Truth be told, to clearly understand your own situation and how things work requires more efforts than we can manage, for now. The result is what I call the *See-saw games*: one terrorist attack, we all become privacy-have-nots; another credit card information leakage, we all become privacy-haves. Polarization doesn't help.

One important part of it is to let the users have some kind of interfaces / languages / tools / protocols to express clearly their preferences. Different people of course have dramatically different view on what is private, and you'll be astonished to find how complicated it is to know even your own mind. One moment you are worrying about NSA/GCHQ is watching you, another you want the whole world to know a funny Facebook photo of yours. You are OK with everyone in a supermarket know the content in your basket, but for some reason your Amazon online shopping list is quite private... With a right language, users can have more complicated conversations with machines without users' too much attention. Two case should be closely checked is:
 
- Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P)
- Semantic Web
- (Maybe need a more updated list?)
