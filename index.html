  <p> Bal’a dash, malanore. Welcome to the Silvermoon City. </p>

  <p>This site is, as the name suggests, a partial log of my essays and fragments I’ve scrawled. But unfortunatelly, that’s also what I had in mind when I first setup this place, only to find that the update interval was like 1 year per blog. </p>

  <p>I’ve tried many other hosting site, Logdown seems really promising, which is obviously more convinient and even more beautiful than what a Jekyll based site can provide. However, there is something wrong with that one ... </p>

  <p>As always, staying simple is the best stragety. </p>

  <h1 class="page-heading">Posts</h1>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
